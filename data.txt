When they discharge, there is a chemical change in the positive plates of the battery. They change from lead oxide when charged to lead sulfate when discharged. If they remain in the lead sulfate state for a few days, some part of the plate does not return to lead oxide when the battery is recharged. If the battery remains discharged longer, a greater amount of the positive plate will remain lead sulfate. The parts of the plates that become "sulfated" no longer store energy.

Called Fisher Price, and they didn't act surprised in the least. They took the info and gave me the address of a place where I was to take the dead new battery and exchange it.  That trip involved a van loaded with 3 kids which got stuck in a traffic jam.  When I got to the store, their new shipment of batteries hadn't come in as scheduled.  The man was nice enough to locate a battery in the store, and I have no idea if it is new or used... he did test it before he gave it to me, and it has worked in the dune racer today.I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product from Amazon. The reviews I read were all over the spectrum, with many folks having an experience similar to mine.  Save aggravation and go to a store which will test the battery before you purchase it.  It will save you all sorts of aggravation.
